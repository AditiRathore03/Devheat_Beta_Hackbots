- # Introduction

Welcome to the README file for the **CodeCrush Cafe** website! This document is your comprehensive guide to understanding and using our platform, where hackathon enthusiasts can `connect`, `collaborate` and `participate in online hackathons`.

# Quick Start 

üìÑ Clone or fork this repo :
`https://github.com/AditiRathore03/Devheat_Beta_Hackbots.git`:

```sh

```

üíø Install all dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Run your App:

# Backend

  At the `Backend` of this App, A `Nodejs` server is running, which manages all the `requests` and `responses` from the user. 
This App Uses Some Node_Modules in order to work properly which include:
- `Mongoose`
    - allows a server to indicate any origins other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources.
- `Express`
  - create a web-server
  - handles request and response

- For end-to-end encryption here we are not storing the data and hence when the page reloads all the filters disappear.


# Database

We are using `MongoDB` for all its database needs. This App uses DB to:
 
 - **User Profiles:** Store user information, including names, email addresses and skills in a database. 
 - **Hackathon Data:** Maintain a database of hackathon events including event names, dates and themes.
 - **Teammate Matching:** Implement algorithms that match users with potential teammates based on their skills, interests, and hackathon preferences. 
   

# Future Aspirations for this App

There are some features that can be added in the future:
- `Integrate real-time chat` and collaboration tools to facilitate communication among team members.
- `Provide a repository` of resources, tutorials, and templates for hackathon participants to access during their projects.
- Allow users to create and `share blog posts, tutorials or project` showcases related to their hackathon experiences.
- Supporting virtual hackathons with additional features like `video conferencing` and `remote collaboration tools`.
- Expand user profiles to `include project portfolios & GitHub repositories` that showcase their skills and achievements.
- `Offer an API` that allows developers to build their own applications or integrations using your platform's data.
